    <h1>Unreasonable Hospitality Notes</h1>

    <p>What would you attempt to do if you knew you could not fail?</p>

    <p>Growth always happens outside of your comfort zone.</p>

    <p>
      Sometimes magic is just someone spending more time on something than
      anyone else might reasonably expect - Teller
    </p>

    <p>The overthinking picker of nits and the finder of faults…</p>

    <p>
      I believe you can speak things into existence. I know this for sure: if
      you don’t have the courage to state a goal out loud, you will never
      achieve it.
    </p>

    <p>
      How do you make them feel seen and valued? How do you give the sense of
      belonging? How do you make them feel part of something bigger than
      themselves? How do you make them feel welcome?
    </p>

    <p>How you serve your plans is as important as what you serve.</p>

    <p>
      Hospitality is a selfish pressure. It feels great to make other people
      feel good.
    </p>

    <p>
      To do something with intentionality means to do it thoughtfully, with
      clear purpose, and an eye on the desired result.
    </p>

    <p>
      Language builds culture. So if you’re not talking, you are not shaping up
      the culture of your team and when you are not shaping up the culture of
      the team you may be handed over a culture which you do not like.
    </p>

    <p>
      I am excited to be here. I believe in and love this team with all my
      heart. I am also clear about what my job is, which is to do what is best
      for the team, not to do what is best for any of you. More often than not ,
      what is best for the team will include doing what is best for you. But the
      only way I can take care of all of you as individuals is by putting the
      team first.
    </p>

    <p>
      I have certainly expressed exasperation and disappointment in Waze that
      were not textbook. Illustrations of how we handle the correction in the
      workplace.
    </p>

    <p>
      A daily 30 minute meeting is where a collection of individuals becomes a
      team. In order to become a team, we needed to stop, take a deep breath,
      and communicate with one another.
    </p>

    <p>
      Consistency is one of the most important and underrated aspects of being a
      leader.
    </p>

    <p>Culture cannot be taught. It has to be caught.</p>

    <p>
      Morale is fickle, and even one individual can have an outsize and a
      symmetrical impact on the team, in either direction.
    </p>

    <p>
      Here is the important tenet of public speaking – tell them what you are
      going to tell them, tell them, then tell them what you have told them.
    </p>

    <p>
      Sometimes the only way to proceed in pursuit of good partnership is to
      decide that whoever cares more about the issue can have their way.
    </p>

    <p>
      You cannot establish any standard of excellence without criticism. So
      thoughtful approach to how you correct people must be a part of your
      culture. Praise is affirmation; criticism is investment.
    </p>

    <p>
      If your response to criticism is consistently defensive, people are
      eventually going to stop coming to you with notes, you have made it too
      unpleasant for them to continue and they are going to stop investing in
      you, and you are going to stop growing as a result.
    </p>

    <p>
      Behavioral science expert Rory Sutherland says the opposite of a good idea
      should also be a good idea. That’s why the idea of unreasonable
      hospitality was so comforting. The opposite of unreasonable hospitality is
      reasonable hospitality, and not treating people poorly.
    </p>

    <p>Luxury means giving more; hospitality is being more thoughtful.</p>

    <p>
      Gifts are a way to tell people you saw, heard, and recognize them – that
      you cared enough to listen and to do something with what you heard. A gift
      transforms an interaction, taking it from transactional to relational.
    </p>

    <p>
      The biggest, scariest, most impossible-seeming accomplishments start with
      a simple commitment to do them.
