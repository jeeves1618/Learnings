      <strong>Many different long lived states</strong>
      Since two-state systems are easy to manufacture and work with, most modern
      computers store their information as bits, but these bits are embodied in
      a wide variety of ways. On a DVD, each bit corresponds to whether there is
      or isn’t a microscopic pit at a given point on the plastic surface. On a
      hard drive, each bit corresponds to a point on the surface being
      magnetized in one of two ways. In my laptop’s working memory, each bit
      corresponds to the positions of certain electrons, determining whether a
      device called a micro-capacitor is charged. Some kinds of bits are
      convenient to transport as well, even at the speed of light: for example,
      in an optical fiber transmitting your email, each bit corresponds to a
      laser beam being strong or weak at a given time.
    </p>
    <strong>Substrate Independence</strong>
    <p>
      If you email your friend a document to print, the information may get
      copied in rapid succession from magnetizations on your hard drive to
      electric charges in your computer’s working memory, radio waves in your
      wireless network, voltages in your router, laser pulses in an optical
      fiber and, finally, molecules on a piece of paper. In other words,
      information can take on a life of its own, independent of its physical
      substrate! Indeed, it’s usually only this substrateindependent aspect of
      information that we’re interested in: if your friend calls you up to
      discuss that document you sent, she’s probably not calling to talk about
      voltages or molecules. This is our first hint of how something as
      intangible as intelligence can be embodied in tangible physical stuff
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Biological Memory</strong>
      Our human DNA stores about 1.6 gigabytes, comparable to a downloaded
      movie. As mentioned in the last chapter, our brains store much more
      information than our genes: in the ballpark of 10 gigabytes electrically
      (specifying which of your 100 billion neurons are firing at any one time)
      and 100 terabytes chemically/biologically (specifying how strongly
      different neurons are linked by synapses). Comparing these numbers with
      the machine memories shows that the world’s best computers can now
      out-remember any biological system—at a cost that’s rapidly dropping and
      was a few thousand dollars in 2016.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Difference between brain and computer memory</strong>
      The memory in your brain works very differently from computer memory, not
      only in terms of how it’s built, but also in terms of how it’s used.
      Whereas you retrieve memories from a computer or hard drive by specifying
      where it’s stored, you retrieve memories from your brain by specifying
      something about what is stored. Each group of bits in your computer’s
      memory has a numerical address, and to retrieve a piece of information,
      the computer specifies at what address to look, just as if I tell you “Go
      to my bookshelf, take the fifth book from the right on the top shelf, and
      tell me what it says on page 314.” In contrast, you retrieve information
      from your brain similarly to how you retrieve it from a search engine: you
      specify a piece of the information or something related to it, and it pops
      up. If I tell you “to be or not,” or if I google it, chances are that it
      will trigger “To be, or not to be, that is the question.” Indeed, it will
      probably work even if I use another part of the quote or mess things up
      somewhat. Such memory systems are called auto-associative, since they
      recall by association rather than by address.

      <strong>Baryonic Matter</strong>
      Whereas today’s supermarkets and commodity exchanges sell tens of
      thousands of items we might call “resources,” future life that’s reached
      the technological limit needs mainly one fundamental resource: so-called
      baryonic matter, meaning anything made up of atoms or their constituents
      (quarks and electrons). Whatever form this matter is in, advanced
      technology can rearrange it into any desired substances or objects. Nearly
      all matter that may be encountered or experienced in everyday life is
      baryonic matter, which includes atoms of any sort, and provides them with
      the property of mass. Non-baryonic matter, as implied by the name, is any
      sort of matter that is not composed primarily of baryons. This might
      include neutrinos and free electrons, dark matter, supersymmetric
      particles, axions, and black holes.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Consciousness, cause and effect.</strong>It’s not our Universe
      giving meaning to conscious beings, but conscious beings giving meaning to
      our Universe. So the very first goal on our wish list for the future
      should be retaining (and hopefully expanding) biological and/or artificial
      consciousness in our cosmos, rather than driving it extinct.
    </p>

    <strong>Efficiencies</strong>
    <p>
      Digesting a candy bar is merely 0.00000001% efficient, in the sense that
      it releases a mere ten-trillionth of the energy mc2 that it contains. If
      your stomach were even 0.001% efficient, then you’d only need to eat a
      single meal for the rest of your life. Compared to eating, the burning of
      coal and gasoline are merely 3 and 5 times more efficient, respectively.
      Today’s nuclear reactors do dramatically better by splitting uranium atoms
      through fission, but still fail to extract more than 0.08% of their
      energy. Here are the efficiencies achieved through some processes we know
      of.

      <strong>Vasili Arkhipov</strong>
      On October 27, 1962, during the Cuban Missile Crisis, eleven U.S. Navy
      destroyers and the aircraft carrier USS Randolph had cornered the Soviet
      submarine B-59 near Cuba. The submarine crew had had no contact with
      Moscow for days and didn’t know whether World War III had already begun.
      Then the Americans started dropping small depth charges, which they had,
      unbeknownst to the crew, told Moscow were merely meant to force the sub to
      surface and leave. What the Americans also didn’t know was that the B-59
      crew had a nuclear torpedo that they were authorized to launch without
      clearing it with Moscow. Indeed, Captain Savitski decided to launch the
      nuclear torpedo. Valentin Grigorievich, the torpedo officer, also agreed.
      Fortunately, the decision to launch had to be authorized by three officers
      on board, and one of them, Vasili Arkhipov, said no. It’s sobering that
      very few have heard of Arkhipov, although his decision may have averted
      World War III and been the single most valuable contribution to humanity
      in modern history.
