    <h1>Beyond Entrepreneurship 2.0</h1>
    <p>
      Staying in a corporate job is like a paint-by-numbers kit approach to
      life, where everything is laid out for you, and as long as you stay within
      the lines, you are more or less guaranteed to have a nice picture at the
      end.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you spend your life keeping your options open, that is exactly what you
      will do—spend your life keeping your options open.
    </p>

    <h2>The Right People</h2>
    <p>
      The right people display window and mirror maturity. When things go well,
      the right people point out the window, giving credit to factors other than
      themselves. They shine a light on other people who contributed to the
      success and take little credit themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      And when things go wrong, they don’t blame circumstances or other people
      for the setbacks and failures; they point in the mirror and say, "I am
      responsible."
    </p>

    <h2>Responsibilities Over Jobs</h2>
    <p>
      The right associates understand that they don’t have jobs; they have
      responsibilities. They grasp the difference between their task list and
      their true responsibilities. A great doctor doesn’t merely have the job of
      performing procedures but embraces responsibility for the health of the
      patient.
    </p>

    <h2>Leadership</h2>
    <p>
      Most exceptional leaders grow into their capabilities, not because they
      want to be a great leader, but because they are trying to be worthy of the
      people they lead.
    </p>
    <p>
      The cellular structure of any truly great organization is the well-led
      unit, for this is where great things get done. Great leadership at the top
      doesn’t amount to very much without exceptional leadership at the unit
      level.
    </p>

    <h2>Effective Leadership</h2>
    <p>
      Effective leadership has two components: function and style. Leadership is
      the art of getting people to want to do what must be done.
    </p>

    <h2>Speaking Up</h2>
    <p>
      As a member of this engineering team, you have not only the opportunity to
      engage in the dialogue, you have the responsibility to do so. If you fail
      to advance your argument, if you fail to disagree with the most powerful
      person in the room, if you fail to bring solid logic and evidence to the
      debate, then you are failing in that responsibility.
    </p>

    <h2>Time Management</h2>
    <p>
      There is a vital difference between managing time and managing work: work
      is infinite; time is finite. Work expands to fill whatever time is
      allocated to it. To be productive, therefore, you must manage your time,
      not your work. The key question to ask yourself is not “What am I going to
      do?” but “How am I going to spend my time?”
    </p>

    <h2>Leadership Styles</h2>
    <p>
      A micromanager doesn’t trust his people and seeks to control every single
      detail and decision; he believes that ultimately only he will make the
      right choices. A personal-touch leader, on the other hand, trusts his
      people to make fundamentally good choices and respects their abilities.
    </p>

    <h2>Constructive Criticism</h2>
    <p>
      When things don’t go well, don’t criticize the person. Just examine the
      events.
    </p>

    <h2>Business and Profit</h2>
    <p>
      Profit, like breathing, is indispensable. But it is not the sole goal of
      our business.
    </p>

    <h2>Great Business vs. Bad Business</h2>
    <p>
      How do you know if you have a truly great business? Warren Buffett has the
      best answer: “You don’t have to hold a prayer meeting to raise prices.” If
      you cannot control prices, you have to control costs.
    </p>
    <p>
      How do you know if you have a truly bad business? You are too small to
      take advantage of cost economies of scale yet not differentiated enough to
      justify higher prices than the competition. You are stuck in the middle,
      and it is deadly.
    </p>

    <h2>Innovation</h2>
    <p>Innovation is an idea that is implemented.</p>

    <h2>Strategic Momentum</h2>
    <p>Breakthrough momentum is achieved through a flywheel:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Consecutive consistency</li>
      <li>Productive paranoia</li>
    </ul>
