        Commissioner of Lost Causes is a compelling reminder that democracy is
        not self-sustaining — it must be defended every single day. Arun
        Shourie, through sharp reporting and fearless commentary, takes the
        reader into moments when India’s institutions began bending to the will
        of those in power.
      </p>
      <p>
        The book chronicles significant episodes with depth and clarity: Bofors
        scandal, Mandal Commission, the Bhagalpur blindings of the early ’80s,
        the Bihar Press Bill under, Ashwin Sarin’s women trafficking exposé,
        Chief Minister Abdul Rahman Antulay’s trusts, the murky $175 million Kuo
        oil deal pushed through successive petroleum ministers, the 1988
        Defamation Bill that sparked a renewed fight for press freedom, and the
        Postal Bill that passed with a mere 20 MPs present. The Thakkur
        commission report’s suspicion on officials in Mrs.Gandhi's assasination
        also finds a place in these pages.
      </p>
      <p>
        One of the book’s strengths is how it exposes the uneasy dependence of
        Indian newspapers on government advertising — a structural weakness that
        makes sustained criticism of government policy rare.
      </p>

      <p>
        The anecdotes, backed by Shourie’s characteristic wit and indignation,
        are punctuated with powerful lines such as,
        <em>“The official secrets act was the last refuge of every crook”</em>
        and,
        <em
          >“Our (journalist's) work must be such that, when the powerful silence
          us, the reader must feel that his tongue has been yanked out.”</em
        >

        Perhaps most memorable is Shourie’s Magsaysay Award speech, where he
        observes that <em>“parasites have become rulers”</em> and that the real
        tragedy
        <em
          >is not the misuse of power by rulers, but the failure of citizens to
          use their own power to stop them</em
        >.
      </p>
      <p>
        I’m holding back from giving it a full 5 stars because at times the
        prose could have been tighter — an editor’s hand might have trimmed
        repetitions and made the narrative even more impactful.
