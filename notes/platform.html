      <strong>What is a platform?</strong>
      A platform is a business based on enabling value-creating interactions
      between external producers and consumers. The platform provides an open,
      participative infrastructure for these interactions and sets governance
      conditions for them. The platform’s overarching purpose: to consummate
      matches among users and facilitate the exchange of goods, services, or
      social currency, thereby enabling value creation for all participants.
    </p>

    <strong>Platform vs Pipeline</strong>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Platforms beat pipelines because platforms unlock new sources of value
        creation and supply.
      </li>
      <li>
        Platforms beat pipelines because platforms scale more efficiently by
        eliminating gatekeepers.
      </li>
      <li>
        Platforms beat pipelines by using data-based tools to create community
        feedback loops.
      </li>
      <li>
        Platforms invert the firm. Because the bulk of a platform’s value is
        created by its community of users, the platform business must shift its
        focus from internal activities to external activities.
      </li>
      <li>
        Platforms focussess on demand economies of scale. Pipeline focusses on
        supply economies of scale.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <strong>Network Effects</strong>
    <p>
      Network effects refers to the impact that the number of users of a
      platform has on the value created for each user. Positive network effects
      refers to the ability of a large, well-managed platform community to
      produce significant value for each user of the platform. Negative network
      effects refers to the possibility that the growth in numbers of a
      poorly-managed platform community can reduce the value produced for each
      user.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Frictionless Entry</strong>
      Platforms which permit frictionless entry are able to grow organically
      almost without bound. Frictionless entry is the ability of users to
      quickly and easily join a platform and begin participating in the value
      creation that the platform facilitates.
