          Just as the engine of growth in the Industrial Revolution was
          standardization, with workers as laboring bodies confined to execute
          “the one best way” to get almost any task done, growth today is driven
          by ideas and ingenuity.

          Today’s employees, at all levels, spend 50% more time collaborating
          than they did 20 years ago.

          Psychological safety is not immunity from consequences, nor is it a
          state of high self-regard. In psychologically safe workplaces, people
          know they might fail, they might receive performance feedback that
          says they’re not meeting expectations, and they might lose their jobs
          due to changes in the industry environment or even to a lack of
          competence in their role. These attributes of the modern workplace are
          unlikely to disappear anytime soon.
