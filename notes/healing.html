      <h1>A Shallow Recap Disguised as a Modern Guide</h1>

        <span class="book-title">Healing the Modern Brain</span> by Drew Ramsey

        The author repeatedly emphasizes the importance of nutrition, sleep, and
        social connection — pillars of well-being that are certainly important,
        but hardly <b>“modern”</b> or revelatory. If you're new to this
        territory and haven’t read <em>Outlive</em>, <em>Why We Sleep</em>, or
        <em>Social</em>, you might find value here. But for anyone even mildly
        familiar with recent literature on psychology, mental health, or
        lifestyle science, this book feels redundant and unnecessarily
        elaborate.
      </p>
      <p>
        Worse, Ramsey touches on crucial ideas like neuroplasticity,
        inflammation, microbiomes, and even psychotherapy, but never dives deep.
        For example, his mention of psychotherapy relies on Freud’s oft-quoted
        definition of <q>making the unconscious conscious</q> — a throwaway line
        that’s never meaningfully expanded. These concepts form the supposed
        foundation of his thesis, but they're left disconnected, underdeveloped,
        and frustratingly vague.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>My biggest gripe?</b> There is nothing “modern” in
        <span class="book-title">Healing the Modern Brain</span>. It completely
        sidesteps the true challenges of our time — the psychological toll of
        living in an AI-saturated world, the identity dissonance fueled by
        social media, and the chronic overstimulation of digital life. Instead,
        it recycles familiar advice about diet, rest, and social ties without
        offering new insights or practical frameworks tailored to today’s unique
        pressures.
      </p>
      <p>
        In short, this book may work for someone just beginning to explore
        mental health. But if you're looking for depth, originality, or a
        genuine engagement with what it means to heal today’s brain, look
        elsewhere.
