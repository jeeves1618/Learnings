    <h2>Cancer and Cell Growth</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Hypertrophy:</strong> Individual cells grow larger.</li>
      <li><strong>Hyperplasia:</strong> Increase in the number of cells.</li>
      <li>
        <strong class="highlight">Cancer:</strong> A form of pathological
        hyperplasia where cells acquire an <em>autonomous will to increase</em>.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Cancer and Cell Division</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Pathological Mitosis:</strong> Uncontrolled cell division leads to
      cancer.
    </p>

    <h2>Genetic Information Flow</h2>
    <p><strong>Normal Flow:</strong> DNA → RNA → Protein</p>
    <p><strong>Transcription:</strong> DNA → RNA</p>

    <h2>Retroviruses and Cancer</h2>
    <p>
      Some viruses can create <strong>DNA out of RNA</strong>. These viruses are
      called <strong>retroviruses</strong>.
    </p>
    <h2>Oncogene</h2>
    <p>
      An oncogene is a gene that has the potential to cause cancer. It arises
      from a mutation or overexpression of normal genes called proto-oncogenes,
      which play a key role in regulating cell growth and division. When these
      proto-oncogenes become altered, they can lead to uncontrolled cell
      proliferation, resulting in tumor formation.
    </p>
    <h2>Key Points about Oncogenes:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Normal Role (Proto-oncogenes):</strong> Regulate normal cell
        growth and differentiation.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Mutation & Activation:</strong> When mutated or overexpressed,
        proto-oncogenes turn into oncogenes.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Effect on Cells:</strong> Promotes unchecked cell division,
        avoiding apoptosis (natural cell death).
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Causes of Activation:</strong> Genetic mutations, chromosomal
        translocations, viral infections, or environmental factors like
        carcinogens and radiation.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>How Oncogenes Contribute to Cancer:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Bypass normal growth control mechanisms, leading to tumor formation.
      </li>
      <li>
        Often work with other genetic mutations (e.g., tumor suppressor gene
        loss) to drive cancer progression.
      </li>
      <li>
        Targeted therapies, such as
        <strong>HER2 inhibitors (Trastuzumab)</strong> or
        <strong>BCR-ABL inhibitors (Imatinib)</strong>, are designed to block
        oncogene activity.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Cytotoxic Chemotherapy</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Cytotoxic chemotherapy</strong> is a type of cancer treatment that
      uses drugs to kill or damage rapidly dividing cells, including cancer
      cells. The term "cytotoxic" means <em>toxic to cells</em>, and
      chemotherapy drugs work by interfering with cell division, ultimately
      leading to cell death (apoptosis) or stopping cells from multiplying.
    </p>

    <h2>How Cytotoxic Chemotherapy Works</h2>
    <p>
      Cancer cells divide uncontrollably, and cytotoxic chemotherapy targets
      this process. It primarily affects cells in the
      <strong>mitotic phase</strong> (actively dividing). However, it does not
      distinguish between cancerous and normal rapidly dividing cells, leading
      to side effects.
    </p>

    <h2>Mechanisms of Action</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Alkylating Agents</strong> (e.g., Cyclophosphamide) - Damage DNA
        to prevent cell division.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Antimetabolites</strong> (e.g., Methotrexate, 5-Fluorouracil) -
        Mimic natural substances in DNA and RNA synthesis.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Topoisomerase Inhibitors</strong> (e.g., Doxorubicin, Etoposide)
        - Interfere with DNA unwinding enzymes.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Mitotic Inhibitors</strong> (e.g., Paclitaxel, Vincristine) -
        Disrupt microtubules, preventing mitosis.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Cytotoxic Antibiotics</strong> (e.g., Doxorubicin, Bleomycin) -
        Cause breaks in DNA strands.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Side Effects</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Bone marrow suppression</strong> - Low blood cell counts
        (anemia, infections, bleeding).
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Gastrointestinal issues</strong> - Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Hair loss (Alopecia)</strong> - Due to damage to hair follicle
        cells.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Reproductive effects</strong> - Potential infertility risks.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Usage in Cancer Treatment</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Curative intent</strong> - Eliminating cancer (e.g., leukemia,
        lymphoma).
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Adjuvant therapy</strong> - Used after surgery/radiation to kill
        residual cells.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Neoadjuvant therapy</strong> - Given before surgery to shrink
        tumors.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Palliative care</strong> - Slowing progression in advanced
        cases.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Advancements and Alternatives</h2>
    <p>
      While cytotoxic chemotherapy is effective, newer treatments such as
      <strong>targeted therapies, immunotherapy, and hormone therapy</strong>
      are being developed to reduce side effects and improve outcomes.
    </p>
    <h2>Historical Context</h2>

    <p>
      <span class="fake-news"
        >Retroviruses cause cancer (P. 355 - Fake news)</span
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      Later discovered that retroviruses cause <strong>AIDS</strong>, not
      cancer.
    </p>

    <h2>Genetic or Pathway Disease?</h2>

    <p>
      The genes that most frequently mutated in the cancer genes may look
      erratic and random. But, they have another property. They organize
      themselves as specific pathways.
    </p>
    <p>
      Later discovered that retroviruses cause <strong>AIDS</strong>, not
      cancer.
    </p>

    <h2>Further Exploration</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Src Gene (P. 361):</strong> Investigated as a possible cause of
      cancer.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Cancer and Genetics:</strong> Cancer is
      <em>intrinsically loaded into our genes</em>, waiting for activation.
    </p>
    <h2>The Core Idea</h2>
    <p>
      Is the end of cancer conceivable in the future? Is it possible to
      eradicate this disease from our bodies and our societies forever?
    </p>
    <p>
      The answers to these questions are embedded in the biology of this
      incredible disease. Cancer, we have discovered, is stitched into our
      genome. Oncogenes arise from mutations in essential genes that regulate
      the growth of cells. Mutations accumulate in these genes when DNA is
      damaged by carcinogens, but also by seemingly random errors in copying
      genes when cells divide. The former might be preventable, but the latter
      is endogenous. Cancer is a flaw in our growth, but this flaw is deeply
      entrenched in ourselves. We can rid ourselves of cancer, then, only as
      much as we can rid ourselves of the processes in our physiology that
      depend on growth—aging, regeneration, healing, reproduction.
    </p>
    <p>
      Science embodies the human desire to understand nature; technology couples
      that desire with the ambition to control nature. These are related
      impulses—one might seek to understand nature in order to control it—but
      the drive to intervene is unique to technology. Medicine, then, is
      fundamentally a technological art; at its core lies a desire to improve
      human lives by intervening on life itself. Conceptually, the battle
      against cancer pushes the idea of technology to its far edge, for the
      object being intervened upon is our genome. It is unclear whether an
      intervention that discriminates between malignant and normal growth is
      even possible. Perhaps cancer, the scrappy, fecund, invasive, adaptable
      twin to our own scrappy, fecund, invasive, adaptable cells and genes, is
      impossible to disconnect from our bodies. Perhaps cancer defines the
      inherent outer limit of our survival. As our cells divide and our bodies
      age, and as mutations accumulate inexorably upon mutations, cancer might
      well be the final terminus in our development as organisms.
