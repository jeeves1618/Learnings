        <li>
          The process undergone by artificial intelligence to acquire knowledge
          and capability is called machine learning.
        </li>
        <li>
          While the advancement of AI may be inevitable, its ultimate
          destination is not.
        </li>
        <li>
          AI promises to transform all realms of human experience. At its core,
          this transformation will occur at the philosophical level, changing
          how humans understand reality and our role within it.
        </li>
        <li>
          Artificial intelligence is altering the human relationship with reason
          and reality. This is a revolution for which existing philosophical
          concepts and social institutions leave us largely unprepared.
        </li>
        <li>
          Artificial intelligence does not possess self-awareness – in other
          words, the ability to reflect on its role in the world.
        </li>
        <li>
          The conviction that what we see reflects reality — and that we can
          fully comprehend at least aspects of this reality using discipline and
          reason — inspired the Greek philosophers to great achievements.
        </li>
        <li>
          Aided by advancements in printing technology, the leaders of the
          Protestant Reformation declared individuals are capable of — indeed,
          responsible for — defining the divine for themselves.
        </li>
        <li>
          The Reformation validated the possibility of individual faith existing
          independent of church arbitration. From that point forward, received
          authority became subject to the probing and testing of autonomous
          inquiry.
        </li>
        <li>
          The Reformation and Renaissance inspired new inquiries into the
          underlying mechanisms of the natural world. This exploration of
          historical knowledge, and an increasing sense of agency over the
          mechanisms of society, also inspired geographic exploration.
        </li>
        <li>
          This exploration resulted in confrontations with a new aspect of
          reality: societies with different gods, divergent histories, and
          independently developed forms of economic, achievement, and social
          complexity. Such experiences began to broaden the aperture of the
          Western mind.
        </li>
        <li>
          When scientific advancements met theological bedrock, the outcome was
          incongruence: societies remained united in their monotheism but
          divided by competing interpretations and explorations of reality.
          Societies needed a concept — indeed, a philosophy — to guide their
          quest to understand the world and their role in it. The philosophers
          of Enlightenment answered the call, declaring reason both the method
          and the purpose for interacting with the environment.
        </li>
        <li>
          The minds that set out on the journey of reason were willing to walk a
          precarious path, risking the apparent certainty of their cultural
          traditions and their established conceptions of reality.
        </li>
        <li>
          In his work "Critique of Pure Reason," Kant argued that:
          <ul>
            <li>
              We do not perceive the world “as it is” (the noumenon), but as it
              appears to us (the phenomenon) through our own mental faculties.
            </li>
            <li>
              He claimed that the human mind actively shapes experience by
              structuring it through categories like time, space, and causality.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          According to Immanuel Kant, while the human mind might present an
          imperfect picture of reality, it is the only picture available. This
          lack of an alternative to the human mind is resolved with the arrival
          of artificial intelligence. AI is beginning to provide an alternative
          means of accessing — and thus understanding — reality.
        </li>
        <li>
          Austrian philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein said that knowledge wants to
          be found in generalizations about similarities across phenomena. He
          termed this "family resemblances." Later, in the 21st century, his
          ideas influenced artificial intelligence and machine learning. His
          theories posited that AI’s potential lay partly in its ability to scan
          large data sets to learn types and patterns.
        </li>
        <li>
          Even if AI would never know something in the way a human mind could,
          an accumulation of matches with the patterns of reality could
          approximate — and sometimes exceed — the performance of human
          perception and reason.
        </li>
        <li>
          As Kant predicted, humans have interpreted the world according to the
          structure of their own minds. But as humans began to approach the
          limits of their cognitive capability, they became willing to enlist
          machines to augment their thinking in order to transcend their
          cognitive limitations.
        </li>
        <li>
          With AI, we have reached a tipping point: we can no longer conceive of
          some of our innovations as extensions of what we already know.
        </li>
        <li>
          Information is not self-explanatory. It is context-dependent. To be
          useful, or at least meaningful, it must be understood through the
          lenses of culture and history. In other words, when information is
          contextualized, it becomes knowledge.
        </li>
        <li>
          The internet inundates users with the opinions of thousands — even
          millions — of other users, depriving them of the solitude required for
          sustained reflection that, historically, has led to the development of
          convictions. As solitude diminishes, so too does fortitude — not only
          to develop convictions but also to be faithful to them, particularly
          when they require traveling novel, and thus often lonely, roads.
        </li>
        <li>
          Programming to ML: We went from attempting to encode human-distilled
          insights into machines to delegating the learning process itself to
          the machines. Learned rather than directly specified. The formalistic
          and inflexible systems — successful only in domains whose tasks could
          be achieved by encoding clear rules based on human insights — got
          replaced by indeterministic and flexible artificial intelligence
          systems.
        </li>
        <li>
          Why do we need machine learning: the variability and subtlety of the
          real world do not reduce to simple rules.
        </li>
        <li>
          To translate one language to another, a translator needs to capture
          specific patterns: sequential dependencies.
        </li>
        <li>
          Human perception and experience filtered through reason have long
          defined our understanding of reality. With the advent of AI, the
          individual human mind is no longer reality's sole or perhaps even its
          principal navigator.
        </li>
        <li>
          Today’s near-constant stream of media increases the cost and decreases
          the frequency of contemplation. Algorithms promote what seizes
          attention in response to the human desire for stimulation, and what
          seizes attention is often the dramatic, the surprising, and the
          emotional. Whether an individual can find space in this environment
          for careful thought is one matter. Another is that the now dominant
          forms of communication are non-conducive to the promotion of tempered
          reasoning.
        </li>
        <li>
          Examples like AlphaZero, AlphaGo, AlphaFold, and the creation of
          Halicin antibiotic show that there are ways of knowing that are not
          available to human consciousness. To expand the frontiers of
          contemporary knowledge, we may ask AI to probe realms we cannot enter;
          it may return with parameters or predictions we do not fully grasp.
        </li>
        <li>
          Accessed by AI, new horizons are opening before us. Previously, the
          limits of our minds constrained our ability to aggregate and analyze
          data, filter, process news and conversations, and interact socially in
          the digital domain. AI permits us to navigate these more effectively.
          In doing so, it not only expands physical reality but also the
          pyramid, expansion, and organization of the burgeoning digital world.
        </li>
        <li>
          Yet at the same time, AI subtracts. It hastens dynamics that erode
          human reason as we have come to understand it: social media, which
          diminishes the space for reflection, and online searching, which
          decreases the impetus for conceptualization. As deep reading and
          analysis contract, so too do the traditional rewards for undertaking
          these processes.
