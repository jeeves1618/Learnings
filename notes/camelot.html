      <p>
        Seymour M. Hersh’s
        <span class="book-title">The Dark Side of Camelot</span> is not just a
        biography of John F. Kennedy — it is a much-needed counterbalance to
        decades of glorified storytelling, myth-making, and national nostalgia.
        In an era when public memory leans heavily on the romanticized vision of
        JFK’s “Camelot” years, Hersh dares to remind us that the light of that
        legendary court casts long, troubling shadows.
      </p>
      <p>
        One of the most important lenses through which to read this book is as a
        <b>balancing act</b>. As readers, we are often too trusting when books
        present celebrated leaders in a glowing light. When Jackie Kennedy
        famously likened the White House years to a “brief shining moment from
        Camelot,” no one demanded documentation or independent verification. We
        welcomed the myth because it comforted us. Yet when Hersh paints an
        unflattering portrait of the same man — the instinctive response from
        many readers is to demand an unusual burden of proof.
      </p>
      <p>
        Herein lies the irony: why should the requirement of evidence be greater
        when exposing flaws than when celebrating virtues? If we accept
        mythologizing without question, we should at least allow skepticism when
        someone attempts to crack that mythology — even if all the details
        cannot be triangulated with certainty. This, to me, is the greatest
        strength of The Dark Side of Camelot: it forces the reader to reckon
        with their own biases about leadership narratives.
      </p>
      <p>
        Critics of the book often point to the improbability of some claims. But
        this skepticism overlooks a deeper truth:
        <b
          >those who ascend to the highest echelons of power are not ordinary
          men living ordinary lives.</b
        >
        The very path to political power often demands a shedding of
        conventional restraint and empathy. As Hersh implies — and history
        across cultures confirms — the environment of supreme authority can warp
        even the most ‘normal’ individuals into making decisions and behaving in
        ways that defy everyday logic. Thus, the burden of proof for ‘abnormal’
        behavior need not be impossibly high; after all,
        <b
          >abnormal circumstances can produce abnormal behavior without
          demanding abnormal proof.</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        Some of Hersh’s more serious charges — such as Kennedy’s willingness to
        prolong involvement in Vietnam purely to secure a second term, or his
        naive overconfidence in outmaneuvering the Russians to appear brilliant
        before his aides — are not only plausible but find supporting evidence
        in other credible historical sources. These claims align with broader
        patterns visible in other well-documented accounts of Kennedy’s
        decision-making.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, the book’s reliance on unnamed or uncorroborated sources —
        particularly Secret Service agents whose testimonies are difficult to
        verify — is a legitimate weakness. This limitation is not to be
        dismissed lightly; responsible historical writing demands verifiability.
        But these gaps do not invalidate the book’s purpose or contribution.
        Rather, they highlight the inherent difficulty of breaking through
        decades of carefully curated political legend.
      </p>
      <p>
        Despite these shortcomings, I believe The Dark Side of Camelot fully
        deserves a five-star rating. Why? Because
        <b
          >Hersh succeeds in performing a rare service: challenging readers to
          view political leadership with skepticism rather than blind
          reverence.</b
        >
        In a healthy democracy, this is not only valuable — it is essential. We
        need works like this to remind us that power corrupts, that myth is not
        history, and that truth is rarely pure or simple.
      </p>
      <p>
        In conclusion, this book should not be dismissed for its uncomfortable
        revelations or imperfections in sourcing. Instead, it should be seen as
        part of the ongoing struggle to
        <b>balance adulation with accountability, reverence with realism.</b>
        Hersh’s book is an unsettling, provocative, and deeply necessary
        corrective to the legend of Camelot — and for that alone, it merits the
        highest praise.
