        How does a service mesh work?
      </h2>
      <div class="lb-txt-14 lb-rtxt">
        <p>
          A service mesh removes the logic governing service-to-service
          communication from individual services and abstracts communication to
          its own infrastructure layer. It uses several network proxies to route
          and track communication between services.
        </p>
        <p>
          A proxy acts as an intermediary gateway between your organization’s
          network and the microservice. All traffic to and from the service is
          routed through the proxy server. Individual proxies are sometimes
          called <em>sidecars</em>, because they run separately but are
          logically next to each service. Taken together, the proxies form the
          service mesh layer.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          &nbsp;<img
            src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/1b6453892473a467d07372d45eb05abc2031647a/2018/11/28/appmesh-proxy-1024x341.png"
          />
        </p>
        <p>
          There are two main components in service mesh architecture—the control
          plane and the data plane.
        </p>
        <h3><strong>Data plane</strong></h3>
        <p>
          The data plane is the data handling component of a service mesh. It
          includes all the sidecar proxies and their functions. When a service
          wants to communicate with another service, the sidecar proxy takes
          these actions:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>The sidecar intercepts the request</li>
          <li>It encapsulates the request in a separate network connection</li>
          <li>
            It establishes a secure and encrypted channel between the source and
            destination proxies
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          The sidecar proxies handle low-level messaging between services. They
          also implement features, like circuit breaking and request retries, to
          enhance resiliency and prevent service degradation. Service mesh
          functionality—like load balancing, service discovery, and traffic
          routing—is implemented in the data plane.
        </p>
        <h3><strong>Control plane</strong></h3>
        <p>
          The control plane acts as the central management and configuration
          layer of the service mesh.
        </p>
        <p>
          With the control plane, administrators can define and configure the
          services within the mesh. For example, they can specify parameters
          like service endpoints, routing rules, load balancing policies, and
          security settings. Once the configuration is defined, the control
          plane distributes the necessary information to the service mesh's data
          plane.
        </p>
        <p>
          The proxies use the configuration information to decide how to handle
          incoming requests. They can also receive configuration changes and
          adapt their behavior dynamically. You can make real-time changes to
          the service mesh configuration without service restarts or
          disruptions.
        </p>
        <p>
          Service mesh implementations typically include the following
          capabilities in the control plane:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Service registry that keeps track of all services within the mesh
          </li>
          <li>
            Automatic discovery of new services and removal of inactive services
          </li>
          <li>
            Collection and aggregation of telemetry data like metrics, logs, and
            distributed tracing information
          </li>
        </ul>
