        <h2>The Black Swan</h2>
        <h3>Nassim Nicholas Taleb</h3>
        <p>
          This book illuminated the significant role of randomness in our lives.
          It helped me appreciate the profound impact of rare, high-impact
          events, often overlooked due to their low probability.

        <h2>Atlas Shrugged</h2>
        <h3>Ayn Rand</h3>
        <p>
          Although I don't agree with all the protagonists' whims in this book,
          it has empowered me to live life on my own terms and avoid second-hand
          egoism.

        <h2>Thinking, Fast and Slow</h2>
        <h3>Daniel Kahneman</h3>
        <p>
          This book enabled me to make conscious and intentional decisions. It
          also helped me identify heuristic decisions arising from System 1
          thinking in others.

        <h2>The Years of Lyndon Johnson</h2>
        <h3>Robert A Caro</h3>
        <p>
          This is how history should be writtenâ€”engaging, entertaining, and
          educational. This book captivated my imagination so much that I often
          found myself concerned about Mr. Caro's health during COVID outbreak.

        <h2>The Great War for Civilisation</h2>
        <h3>Robert Fisk</h3>
        <p>
          A much-needed primer on Middle Eastern history, politics, and ongoing
          crises. Mr. Fisk's firsthand accounts can easily rival any Hollywood
          thriller.

        <h2>The Blind Watchmaker</h2>
        <h3>Richard Dawkins</h3>
        <p>
          You'll feel the theory of evolution by natural selection in the marrow
          of your bones. Darwin would be proud of Mr. Dawkins' work.

        <h2>Basic Economics</h2>
        <h3>Thomas Sowell</h3>
        <p>
          Economics, as an emergent phenomenon, isn't instinctive. This book
          demystifies it, making it essential for anyone living in the modern
          economy and aspiring to make the most of scarce and valuable
          resources.

        <h2>Animal Farm</h2>
        <h3>George Orwell</h3>
        <p>
          This book unmasks false altruism and reveals how the unearned power
          usurps resources from the hardworking to the hardly working in
          totalitarian regimes

        <h2>Life 3.0</h2>
        <h3>Max Tegmark</h3>

        <h2>Where Good Ideas Come From</h2>
        <h3>Steven Johnson</h3>
        <p>
          The author eloquently narrates the emergence of the often-overlooked
          aspect of innovative persistence in life. These incremental
          innovations aren't solely driven by heroes but rather by a network of
          agents working in tandem.

        <h2>Algorithms to Live By</h2>
        <h3>Brian Christian</h3>
        <p>
          This book is essential reading for every computer scientist. With a
          proper understanding, it unlocks a treasure trove of optimization
          techniques, enriching both engineering systems and lives alike.

        <h2>Lord of the Rings</h2>
        <h3>J.R.R. Tolkien</h3>
        <p>
          It transports you to the mesmerizing world of Middle Earth with every
          read. The meticulously crafted characters and environments make me
          feel as though I've personally visited the Prancing Pony inn alongside
          Frodo and friends.
