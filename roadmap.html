            "The Java Complete Reference" is a comprehensive guide to Java
            programming, authored by Herbert Schildt. It covers the core
            concepts of the Java language, including its syntax, APIs, and
            advanced features. The book serves as both an introductory text and
            a detailed reference, suitable for beginners and experienced
            programmers alike. It also includes practical examples and exercises
            to help readers apply their knowledge effectively. If you are not
            into books, scroll down.

            Don't be alarmed at the size of the book. Several topics are less
            relevant for developers focusing on Spring Boot because Spring Boot
            abstracts and manages many of those concerns. They are Low-Level
            JDBC and SQL Management, Manual Dependency Injection, XML
            Configuration, Servlet API and Manual Web Application Setup and
            Manual Bean Lifecycle Management

            Don't be scared of the 100+ hours. Most of those hours are for prior
            versions of Java. Many students who have taken Tim Buchalka's Java
            Master Class, have transitioned from non-technical backgrounds into
            software development roles, thanks to the comprehensive and
            practical nature of the course. Some have reported landing jobs as
            Java developers, while others have leveraged their new skills to
            contribute to open-source projects or develop their own
            applications.

            If you’re eager to further deepen your Java knowledge or seeking an
            alternative to "The Complete Reference," consider "Core Java" by Cay
            Horstmann. This book offers a detailed, hands-on approach to Java
            programming, featuring practical examples and a strong focus on
            real-world applications. It explores advanced topics and provides an
            in-depth look at Java’s core libraries and APIs.

            In contrast, "The Java Complete Reference" by Herbert Schildt offers
            a broader, more encyclopedic overview of the Java language and
            standard libraries, making it a versatile resource for both
            beginners and experienced developers. Also, Volume 1 is sufficient
            for most of our use cases. Volume 2 of "Core Java" delves into
            advanced topics such as Java’s concurrency, networking, and GUI
            development, which may not be essential for many Java developers
            focused on web or enterprise applications.

            In comparison, Madan Reddy's "Master Spring 6 & Spring Boot 3"
            course offers a comprehensive exploration of both Spring 6 and
            Spring Boot 3, targeting the latest features and best practices.
            This course includes extensive coverage of advanced topics and new
            updates, providing a more detailed and current perspective on Spring
            technologies. Both courses aim to equip developers with robust
            Spring Boot skills, but Reddy's course delves deeper into the
            concepts and under the hood details.

            covers advanced topics, including modern Spring features, security,
            microservices, and reactive programming, providing a deep dive into
            the newest advancements in the Spring ecosystem. The course is
            designed for those who want to master the latest versions and
            leverage their capabilities in complex, real-world applications.

            In comparison, Chad Derby's Spring Boot course focuses on practical,
            hands-on learning of Spring Boot fundamentals, with an emphasis on
            building real-world applications. While Derby's course provides a
            solid foundation and practical examples, it may not cover the latest
            updates and advanced features in as much detail as Reddy's course.
            Reddy's course is more suitable for developers looking to explore
            more on the "whys" of Spring and Spring Boot.
