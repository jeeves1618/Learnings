                <p>
                  Accounting consists of three basic activities. It
                  <strong>identifies, records and communicates</strong> the
                  economic events of an organization to interested users.
                </p>
                <p>
                  As a starting point, a company has to identify the economic
                  events relevant to business. Once it identifies the events, it
                  records (or bookkeeps) those events in order to provide a
                  history of its financial activities.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Finally, the company communicates the collected information to
                  interested users by means of accounting reports.The most
                  popular accounting reports are called financial statements.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The users of accounting reports can be
                  <strong>internal or external users</strong>. Internal users
                  need detailed information on a timely basis.
                  <strong>Managerial accounting </strong>provides internal
                  reports and dashboards to help users make business decisions.
                  External users are primarily investors (who wants to know
                  whether the company is growing its market share) or creditors
                  (who wants to know whether the company will have money to pay
                  off its debts).

                <p>
                  Generally accepted accounting principles (<a

                    target="_blank"
                    ><strong>GAAP</strong></a
                  >) refer to a common set of accounting rules, standards, and
                  procedures issued by the
                  <strong>Financial Accounting Standards Board</strong>
                  (FASB). Public companies in the U.S. must follow GAAP when
                  their accountants compile their financial statements.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The <strong>Securities Exchange Commission</strong> is the
                  agency of the U.S Government that overseas U.S. financial
                  markets and accounting standard setting bodies. SEC relies on
                  FASB to set the standards.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Companies outside of the U.S. have adopted the accounting
                  standards issued by the
                  <strong>
                    International Accounting Standards Board (IASB)</strong
                  >. These standards are called International Financial
                  Reporting Standards (IFRS). In the recent years, both the
                  standard setting bodies have made efforts to reduce the
                  differences between GAAP and IFRS. This process is referred to
                  as convergence.
