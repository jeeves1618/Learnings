          <strong>Buyers</strong>. The site will be fully responsive, ensuring
          it is accessible on PCs, tablets, and mobile devices.

        <h2>3. Non-Functional Requirements</h2>

        <h3>3.1 Responsiveness</h3>
        <p>
          The application must be fully responsive, using Bootstrap to ensure
          compatibility and optimal viewing on PCs, tablets, and mobile devices.
        </p>

        <h3>3.2 Security</h3>
        <p>
          Implement role-based access control (RBAC) to ensure that farmers and
          buyers can only access functionalities specific to their roles. Secure
          handling of payment information and personal details using SSL
          encryption. Data validation on both client-side (using JavaScript) and
          server-side.
        </p>

        <h3>3.3 Performance</h3>
        <p>
          The application should handle up to 1000 simultaneous users without
          significant performance degradation. Optimize database queries and
          page load times to ensure a seamless user experience.
        </p>

        <h3>3.4 Scalability</h3>
        <p>
          The system architecture should allow easy scaling to accommodate more
          users, items, and transactions as the platform grows.

        <h2>5. Development & Testing</h2>

        <h3>5.1 Development</h3>
        <p>
          Agile methodology will be followed, with iterative sprints for
          continuous development and feature integration. A CI/CD pipeline will
          be established for automated testing and deployment.
        </p>

        <h3>5.2 Testing</h3>
        <p>
          Please consider writing test cases as optional for now. Unit tests for
          backend services using JUnit. Frontend testing with Selenium or an
          equivalent tool. Security testing to ensure the application is secure
          against common vulnerabilities like SQL injection, XSS, etc.
          Performance testing to verify that the application meets performance
          and scalability requirements.
