        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
          This web application will facilitate mentorship by enabling mentors
          and mentees to manage and track learning roadmaps. Developed using
          Java, Spring Boot, Thymeleaf, HTML, and CSS, the application will
          serve two main types of users: <strong>Mentors</strong> and
          <strong>Mentees</strong>. The platform will be responsive and viewable
          on PCs, tablets, and phones.

        <h2>2. Functional Requirements</h2>

        <h3>2.1 Mentor Functionalities</h3>

        <h4>2.1.1 Manage Learning Roadmap</h4>
        <p>
          Mentors can create new learning roadmap items, which can be books,
          online trainings, YouTube videos, or podcasts. They can update details
          such as title, type, description, and other relevant information, and
          delete items if necessary.
        </p>

        <h4>2.1.2 Manage Mentees</h4>
        <p>
          Mentors can add new mentees, update their details, and remove them if
          necessary.
        </p>

        <h4>2.1.3 View Mentee Progress</h4>
        <p>
          Mentors can view the progress of all their mentees, with the mentees
          who have made the most progress listed at the top. They can
          double-click on a mentee's name to see detailed information about
          their assigned roadmap items and their progress.
        </p>

        <h3>2.2 Mentee Functionalities</h3>

        <h4>2.2.1 Assign Roadmap Items</h4>
        <p>
          Mentees can select items from the learning roadmap and assign them to
          themselves. They should be able to specify their current progress on
          these items.
        </p>

        <h4>2.2.2 Update Progress</h4>
        <p>
          Mentees can update their progress on assigned roadmap items, including
          status changes and any relevant notes.
        </p>

        <h4>2.2.3 View Assigned Items</h4>
        <p>
          Mentees can view a list of all the items they have assigned to
          themselves, along with their progress and any associated details.
        </p>

      <div class="section">
        <h2>3. Non-Functional Requirements</h2>

        <h3>3.1 Responsiveness</h3>
        <p>
          The application must be fully responsive using Bootstrap to ensure it
          is viewable on PCs, tablets, and mobile devices.
        </p>

        <h3>3.2 Security</h3>
        <p>
          Implement role-based access control (RBAC) to ensure mentors and
          mentees can only access functionalities specific to their roles.
          Secure handling of user data and progress updates using SSL
          encryption. Data validation on both client-side (using JavaScript) and
          server-side.
        </p>

        <h3>3.3 Performance</h3>
        <p>
          The application should handle up to 500 simultaneous users without
          significant performance degradation. Optimize database queries and
          page load times for a seamless user experience.
        </p>

        <h3>3.4 Scalability</h3>
        <p>
          The system architecture should allow for easy scaling to accommodate
          more users and roadmap items as the platform grows.
        </p>

      <div class="section">
        <h2>5. Development & Testing</h2>

        <h3>5.1 Development</h3>
        <p>
          Agile methodology will be followed, with iterative sprints for
          continuous development and feature integration. A CI/CD pipeline will
          be established for automated testing and deployment.
        </p>

        <h3>5.2 Testing</h3>
        <p>
          Please consider writing test cases as optional for now. Unit tests for
          backend services using JUnit. Frontend testing with Selenium or an
          equivalent tool. Security testing to ensure the application is secure
          against common vulnerabilities like SQL injection, XSS, etc.
          Performance testing to verify that the application meets performance
          and scalability requirements.

      <div class="section">
        <h2>6. Deployment</h2>
        <p>
          The application will be deployed only in your local machine. The
          source code should be added to internal github on a daily basis.
