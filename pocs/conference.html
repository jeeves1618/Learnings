      <section>
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
          The web application will be a conference room management system

          system will have two types of users: <strong>Admins</strong> and
          <strong>Conference Room Users</strong>. The interface will be
          responsive, ensuring it is viewable on PCs, tablets, and mobile
          devices.
        </p>

        <h2>3. Non-Functional Requirements</h2>

        <h3>3.1 Responsiveness</h3>
        <p>
          The application must be fully responsive, using Bootstrap to ensure
          optimal viewing on PCs, tablets, and mobile devices.
        </p>

        <h3>3.2 Security</h3>

        <p>
          The application should load quickly and handle up to 500 simultaneous
          users without significant performance degradation. Efficient database
          queries to minimize load times.
        </p>

        <h3>3.4 Scalability</h3>
