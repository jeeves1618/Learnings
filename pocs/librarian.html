      <section>
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
          The web application will be a library management system developed
          using Java, Spring Boot, Thymeleaf, HTML, and CSS. The system will
          have two types of users: <strong>Librarians</strong> and
          <strong>Members</strong>. The interface will be responsive, ensuring
          it is viewable on PCs, tablets, and mobile devices.
        </p>

        <h2>3. Non-Functional Requirements</h2>

        <h3>3.1 Responsiveness</h3>
        <p>
          The application must be fully responsive, using Bootstrap to ensure
          optimal viewing on PCs, tablets, and mobile devices.
        </p>

        <h3>3.2 Security</h3>
        <p>
          Role-based access control (RBAC) to ensure only authorized users
          (Librarians and Members) can access specific functionalities. Secure
          handling of payment transactions. Data validation on both client-side
          (using JavaScript) and server-side.
        </p>

        <h3>3.3 Performance</h3>
        <p>
          The application should load quickly and handle up to 1000 simultaneous
          users without significant performance degradation. Efficient database
          queries to minimize load times.
        </p>

        <h3>3.4 Scalability</h3>
        <p>
          The application architecture should allow for easy addition of new
          features and scaling to support more users.
        </p>

        <h2>4. Technical Stack</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Backend:</strong> Java, Spring Boot</li>
          <li><strong>Frontend:</strong> Thymeleaf, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap</li>
          <li>
            <strong>Database:</strong> MySQL/PostgreSQL/H2 (or any other
            suitable relational database)
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Payment Gateway:</strong> No need for integration with a
            standard payment gateway like Stripe or PayPal for membership fees.
            It is enough if we persist in the database.
          </li>
        </ul>

      <section>
        <h2>5. Development & Testing</h2>

        <h3>5.1 Development</h3>
        <p>
          The development will follow Agile methodology with iterative sprints.
          Continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) pipelines will be set up
          for automated testing and deployment.
        </p>

        <h3>5.2 Testing</h3>
        <p>
          Please consider writing test cases as optional for now. Unit tests for
          backend services using JUnit. Frontend testing with Selenium or
          equivalent tool. Security testing for role-based access and payment
          processing. Performance testing to ensure the application meets
          performance requirements.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>6. Deployment</h2>
        <p>
          The application will be deployed only in your local machine. The
          source code should be added to internal github on a daily basis.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>7. Documentation</h2>
        <p>
