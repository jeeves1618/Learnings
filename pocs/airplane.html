        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
          This web application will manage the booking and management of
          aircraft for a private airline company. Developed using Java, Spring
          Boot, Thymeleaf, HTML, and CSS, the application will provide a web
          interface for two types of users: <strong>Managers</strong> and
          <strong>Flying Enthusiasts</strong>. The application will handle
          aircraft inventory, route management, and booking processes. It will
          be responsive and accessible on PCs, tablets, and mobile devices.

        <h2>3. Non-Functional Requirements</h2>

        <h3>3.1 Responsiveness</h3>
        <p>
          The application must be fully responsive using Bootstrap to ensure it
          is viewable on PCs, tablets, and mobile devices.
        </p>

        <h3>3.2 Security</h3>
        <p>
          Implement role-based access control (RBAC) to ensure managers and
          enthusiasts only access functionalities specific to their roles.
          Secure handling of booking data and aircraft information with SSL
          encryption. Data validation on both client-side (using JavaScript) and
          server-side.
        </p>

        <h3>3.3 Performance</h3>
        <p>
          The application should handle up to 200 simultaneous users without
          significant performance degradation. Optimize database queries and
          page load times for a seamless user experience.
        </p>

        <h3>3.4 Scalability</h3>
        <p>
          The system architecture should allow for easy scaling to accommodate
          more users, aircraft, and routes as the platform grows.

          backend services using JUnit. Frontend testing with Selenium or an
          equivalent tool. Security testing to ensure the application is secure
          against common vulnerabilities like SQL injection, XSS, etc.
          Performance testing to verify that the application meets performance
          and scalability requirements.
