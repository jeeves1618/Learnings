        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
          This web application will manage coffee shop operations, providing
          interfaces for two types of users: <strong>Baristas</strong> and
          <strong>Patrons</strong>. Developed using Java, Spring Boot,
          Thymeleaf, HTML, and CSS, the application will handle drink inventory
          management, order placement, and order tracking. The platform will be
          responsive and viewable on PCs, tablets, and phones.
        </p>

        <h2>2. Functional Requirements</h2>

        <h3>2.1 Barista Functionalities</h3>

        <h4>2.1.1 Manage Drink Inventory</h4>
        <p>
          Baristas can add new drinks, update existing drink details (e.g.,
          name, description, price), and delete drinks from the inventory.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Example Offerings:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Espresso:</strong> A strong, rich coffee.</li>
          <li>
            <strong>Latte:</strong> Espresso with steamed milk and a light foam.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Cappuccino:</strong> Espresso with equal parts steamed milk
            and foam.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Mocha:</strong> Espresso with chocolate syrup and steamed
            milk.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Cold Brew:</strong> Coffee brewed with cold water over an
            extended period.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h4>2.1.2 Order Management</h4>
        <p>
          Baristas can view all submitted orders, check out orders under their
          name, and mark orders as completed.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Order Checkout:</strong> Once an order is checked out, it is
            locked to prevent other baristas from working on it.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Marking Orders Completed:</strong> Baristas will mark orders
            as completed, which will adjust the inventory accordingly.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>2.2 Patron Functionalities</h3>

        <h4>2.2.1 View Drink Offerings</h4>
        <p>
          Patrons can browse through the list of available drinks with detailed
          descriptions and prices.
        </p>

        <h4>2.2.2 Customize Drinks</h4>
        <p>
          Patrons can choose a drink and customize it with additional condiments
          and add-ons (e.g., milk type, syrup flavors, whipped cream).
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Dynamic Pricing:</strong> The total price will update
          dynamically as add-ons are selected.
        </p>

        <h4>2.2.3 Place Order</h4>
        <p>
          Once patrons finalize their drink customization, they can submit the
          order for processing.
        </p>

        <h2>3. Non-Functional Requirements</h2>

        <h3>3.1 Responsiveness</h3>
        <p>
          The application must be fully responsive using Bootstrap to ensure it
          is viewable on PCs, tablets, and mobile devices.
        </p>

        <h3>3.2 Security</h3>
        <p>
          Implement role-based access control (RBAC) to ensure that patrons and
          baristas only access functionalities specific to their roles. Secure
          handling of order data and inventory information with SSL encryption.
          Data validation on both client-side (using JavaScript) and
          server-side.
        </p>

        <h3>3.3 Performance</h3>
        <p>
          The application should handle up to 200 simultaneous users without
          significant performance degradation. Optimize database queries and
          page load times for a seamless user experience.
        </p>

        <h3>3.4 Scalability</h3>
        <p>
          The system architecture should allow for easy scaling to accommodate
          more users, drinks, and orders as the platform grows.
        </p>

        <h2>4. Technical Stack</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Backend:</strong> Java, Spring Boot</li>
          <li><strong>Frontend:</strong> Thymeleaf, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap</li>
          <li>
            <strong>Database:</strong> MySQL/PostgreSQL/H2 (or any suitable
            relational database)
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div class="section">
        <h2>5. Development & Testing</h2>

        <h3>5.1 Development</h3>
        <p>
          Agile methodology will be followed, with iterative sprints for
          continuous development and feature integration. A CI/CD pipeline will
          be established for automated testing and deployment.
        </p>

        <h3>5.2 Testing</h3>
        <p>
          Please consider writing test cases as optional for now. Unit tests for
          backend services using JUnit. Frontend testing with Selenium or an
          equivalent tool. Security testing to ensure the application is secure
          against common vulnerabilities like SQL injection, XSS, etc.
          Performance testing to verify that the application meets performance
          and scalability requirements.
        </p>

      <div class="section">
        <h2>6. Deployment</h2>
        <p>
          The application will be deployed only in your local machine. The
          source code should be added to internal github on a daily basis.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="section">
        <h2>7. Documentation</h2>
        <p>
          Comprehensive user and technical documentation will be provided to
          assist in future maintenance and upgrades.
